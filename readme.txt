Widget Exercises
--
An exercise in widget-building using HTML5/CSS/JS/JQuery/Bootstrap/SASS/GULP, and dummy data simulating dynamic content.


Bugs:
* Many small details versus the original PSD have been set aside due to time constraints and the fact that, being a screenshot, there's not a lot of info embedded in the PSD (e.g. font types/sizes).
* user avatar in the user-info widget is not fully respnosive--in smaller breakpoints it goes off-centre.  This seems related to the masking techniques used to create the 'circle' version of the image.
